# 🎓 EduCalm: Predicting Student Stress for Better Well-being

> Developed by **Harsh Gahlawat**

**EduCalm** is a smart stress prediction system designed to assist educational institutions and health professionals in identifying students experiencing academic or health-related stress. Using a combination of academic performance and personal well-being indicators, this project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Next.js** to create a real-time web app for early intervention and support.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

With rising mental health issues among students, **EduCalm** serves as a bridge between data and action. Institutions can:

* Identify at-risk students early.
* Tailor support services and counseling.
* Inform policies for academic workload and wellness.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: Node.js/Express (inside `/backend`)
* **ML Model**: Python, scikit-learn
* **Data Source**: Academic records, lifestyle surveys, health indicators
