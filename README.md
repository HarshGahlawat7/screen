# 🌊 SafeVoyage AI: Smart Survival Predictor for Maritime Emergencies

**Created by Harsh Gahlawat**  
**Powered by Random Forest & Real-World Data**

---

> **SafeVoyage AI** is a machine learning-based decision support tool designed to assist in real-time **survivability analysis** during maritime emergencies such as cruise ship evacuations or ferry accidents.  
> Leveraging historical passenger data and a Random Forest Classifier, the tool can estimate the likelihood of survival based on key personal and situational attributes.

## 🧠 Model Insights

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Target Variable:** `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Input Features:**
  - `Pclass` — Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  - `Sex` — Gender
  - `Age` — Passenger Age
  - `SibSp` — Siblings/Spouses Aboard
  - `Parch` — Parents/Children Aboard
  - `Fare` — Ticket Fare
  - `Embarked` — Port of Embarkation  
    (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance

While based on Titanic-era data, this project demonstrates how AI can enhance **disaster response systems**. Emergency responders and maritime authorities could use similar models to:

- Optimize rescue strategies
- Simulate emergency scenarios
- Understand demographic vulnerabilities in disasters
